	Graduating from College
</h2>

	<p class="h4 italic grey-700">Friday was my last day at South Dakota State University.</p>
	<p>Somehow, I expected that leaving <a href="http://sdstate.edu">someplace I&rsquo;d worked for nearly eight years</a> would involve more ceremony. It didn&rsquo;t. I announced that I was leaving and two weeks later, I left. That was pretty much it.</p>

<p>I programmed at State for years but I also wore a lot of other hats&mdash;like providing technical support and content strategy to the university&rsquo;s editors across campus&mdash;and over time I realized that as much as I like coding and as much success as I think we found with that there, the university needed someone to continue wearing those hats.</p>

<p>Later this month I will start my new job as a programmer for <a href="http://good-sam.com">The Good Samaritan Society</a>. Another team handles testing. Another team handles support. Since our team builds web apps rather than a single giant (largely informational) website, I won&rsquo;t be dealing with content in the same way that I did at a large sprawling public university website.</p>

<p>I can&rsquo;t wait to join a larger team with other, more experienced developers with whom I can ask questions or compare thoughts. I can&rsquo;t wait to work with a team that does dedicated testing. I can&rsquo;t wait to hand off support duties.</p>

<p>Most of all, I can&rsquo;t wait to start building software again.</p>
