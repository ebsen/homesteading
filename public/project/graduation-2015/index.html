	<p>An official university landing page to highlight the accomplishments of our graduating bachelors, masters, and Ph.D. students, including live streams of the commencement ceremonies over YouTube, <a href="https://youtu.be/VTRt64lE3uQ">our own original recap video</a>, and curated Instagram and Twitter posts.</p>

<p>As our first experience at streaming live video, we needed a lean website that would perform really well. So we opted to go without a database and we optimized common performance bottlenecks to reduce the size of the page.</p>

<p>I also worked with IT to put together a new way for us to publish the website. This also allows us to much more easily track changes in the code and revert them when bugs are discovered.</p>

<p>The live stream was a huge success for us, reaching hundreds of people across 26 states and 11 countries and reaching the highest number of mobile viewers (32%) of any university website to date. In the time since, the recap video has reached thousands of viewers.</p>

<p>The <a href="//graduation.sdstate.edu">current iteration of the graduation website</a> adds <a href="https://storify.com/SDState/sdstate15">social media integration through Storify</a>, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/user/sdstate/playlist/2xNGtjV0ghaypMHwCmBwfv">a music playlist from Spotify</a>, and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.10152904174661647.1073741842.88914146646&amp;type=1">a Facebook photo album</a>. I also scripted our Git deployment process to make publishing and updating the site much simpler.</p>

<p>Building on success in our 2014, the website reached people in 43 states and 32 countries on commencement day. A strong majority of those visitors (57%) came from mobile, breaking our previous record. The Facebook photo album on the site reached over 100,000 people.</p>
