      <title>Ag Museum</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A custom-themed WordPress site built from Photoshop designs. It features a prominent carousel on the homepage and several post types to display information in various places across the site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I led a team of myself and two student developers to prototype these designs into code. I chose &lt;a href=&#34;http://foundation.zurb.com/&#34;&gt;Foundation&lt;/a&gt; as the front-end framework and &lt;a href=&#34;https://nodejs.org/&#34;&gt;Node.js&lt;/a&gt; to compile it. These technologies helped us built the site responsively, allowing it to work across difference screen sizes. We then converted the resulting code to work with WordPress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was our first project using responsive design and the above technologies. Today, every project we start is responsive, we have several sites running on WordPress, and we use Node with nearly every website we have.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Dice</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; This project is deprecated in favor of &lt;a href=&#34;http://ebsen.me/project/ranger&#34;&gt;Ranger&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This Fourth of July the family and I visited my parents. There, my mom keeps this huge Disney-themed book of board games. the games all use a digital built-in display instead of dice.  Only one problem: the batteries were dead and we couldn&amp;rsquo;t find any dice in the house.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I improvised by writing a very simple node script that returned a random number from one to six. Easy enough. Each played &amp;ldquo;rolled the dice&amp;rdquo; by tapping the Up key to bring up the previous command (this ad hoc dice script, in this case) and hit return to get a new number back. It worked for our game that afternoon (crisis averted!) but I can&amp;rsquo;t say the kids enjoyed it much.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, to simplify things for the next time this happens, I wrapped that little script in a web page. Now, instead of fiddling with an arcane command prompt to &amp;ldquo;roll&amp;rdquo; a digital die, you just click a button.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Upon seeing the project, a friend (who may or may not play a little D&amp;amp;D) called me out for only supporting six-sided die. So I added a Settings pane to allow you to configure the number of imaginary sides on your imaginary die.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(In case you&amp;rsquo;re wondering, the singular of &amp;ldquo;dice&amp;rdquo; is &amp;ldquo;die.&amp;rdquo; I kept saying &amp;ldquo;dice&amp;rdquo; and my wife kept ruthlessly correcting my improper conjugation.)&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Frosty Ticket 2.0</title>
      <link>http://ebsen.me/project/frosty/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As the unit responsible for the university&amp;rsquo;s public web presence, we support about 200 other faculty and staff around campus who regularly edit CommonSpot (and soon, Drupal) or another of our websites in some way. We wanted a way track their requests, both to ensure the work got done but also to build data around how people were using our sites. What common problems did they experience? Where was our documentation failing them?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a joke, an earlier version of this tool was temporarily dubbed &amp;ldquo;Frosty Ticket.&amp;rdquo; The name stuck, so when we decided to rebuild this system in Drupal, I knew we had to name it &lt;em&gt;Frosty Ticket 2.0&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In its current state, Frosty Ticket 2.0 is a simple website. You log in, log the tasks you need to do, and mark them off as they&amp;rsquo;re completed. We can note which college or unit a request belongs or assign a task to another user.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Game Time</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I wanted a super-simple way to keep score at our son&amp;rsquo;s soccer games. The app has two buttons, one for each score. Tap to add a point. Refresh the page to reset both scores to zero.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To make the buttons easier to tap, I placed them especially large and near the bottom of the screen. To eliminate the tap delay on mobile browsers, I added &lt;a href=&#34;http://ftlabs.github.io/fastclick/&#34;&gt;FastClick&lt;/a&gt;. I also disabled page zooming and the bouncy-scroll thing that Safari does at the bottom of the page. In most cases, these UI features serve a purpose. In this case, they introduce complexity and make those two big obvious buttons just a &lt;em&gt;little&lt;/em&gt; harder to hit.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Graduation 2015</title>
      <link>http://ebsen.me/project/graduation-2015/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 12 Mar 2016 10:58:25 -0600</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;An official university landing page to highlight the accomplishments of our graduating bachelors, masters, and Ph.D. students, including live streams of the commencement ceremonies over YouTube, &lt;a href=&#34;https://youtu.be/VTRt64lE3uQ&#34;&gt;our own original recap video&lt;/a&gt;, and curated Instagram and Twitter posts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As our first experience at streaming live video, we needed a lean website that would perform really well. So we opted to go without a database and we optimized common performance bottlenecks to reduce the size of the page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also worked with IT to put together a new way for us to publish the website. This also allows us to much more easily track changes in the code and revert them when bugs are discovered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The live stream was a huge success for us, reaching hundreds of people across 26 states and 11 countries and reaching the highest number of mobile viewers (32%) of any university website to date. In the time since, the recap video has reached thousands of viewers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&#34;//graduation.sdstate.edu&#34;&gt;current iteration of the graduation website&lt;/a&gt; adds &lt;a href=&#34;https://storify.com/SDState/sdstate15&#34;&gt;social media integration through Storify&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://open.spotify.com/user/sdstate/playlist/2xNGtjV0ghaypMHwCmBwfv&#34;&gt;a music playlist from Spotify&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.10152904174661647.1073741842.88914146646&amp;amp;type=1&#34;&gt;a Facebook photo album&lt;/a&gt;. I also scripted our Git deployment process to make publishing and updating the site much simpler.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Building on success in our 2014, the website reached people in 43 states and 32 countries on commencement day. A strong majority of those visitors (57%) came from mobile, breaking our previous record. The Facebook photo album on the site reached over 100,000 people.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Hobo Day Parade</title>
      <link>http://ebsen.me/project/hobo-day-parade/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The website for our first-ever live stream of the annual Hobo Day parade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Built in just a few days, I used a number of new &lt;a href=&#34;https://nodejs.org/&#34;&gt;Node.js&lt;/a&gt; tools. &lt;a href=&#34;http://harpjs.com/&#34;&gt;Harp&lt;/a&gt; produced a local copy of the website (written in two new languages, &lt;a href=&#34;http://jade-lang.com/&#34;&gt;Jade&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&#34;http://lesscss.org/&#34;&gt;Less&lt;/a&gt;) while &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.browsersync.io/&#34;&gt;BrowserSync&lt;/a&gt; let me share that website live to the rest of the team while I worked. This project became the template we use to build the majority of static websites today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Posts to social media in the weeks leading up to Hobo Day help to build a crescendo around the event and the website, leading to more people (62%) watching the parade&amp;rsquo;s live stream from the website than from YouTube itself. Nearly half of viewers (45%) did so from a mobile device, another record at the time.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Holiday Video 2014</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;At the end of each year, the university publishes a video to highlight the accomplishments made by its faculty and staff. This year, that email campaign also kicked off #WeAreSDState, a campaign to promote the university&amp;rsquo;s value around the region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We wanted the website hosting the video to match the email used to distribute it. This led me to experiment with animating backgrounds and cross-fading images in the browser. While the final product didn&amp;rsquo;t ship with these features, they served as excellent reminders that &amp;ldquo;the web&amp;rdquo; isn&amp;rsquo;t the same across screens and devices.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Some time after building &lt;a href=&#34;http://ebsen.me/project/dice&#34;&gt;Dice&lt;/a&gt;, my wife asked if I could modify it to allow a wider range of possible numbers. So I forked Dice to create Ranger.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ranger started just to help her play Bingo with the kids but I hope to get back around it it and rebuild it with &lt;a href=&#34;http://elm-lang.org&#34;&gt;Elm&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>West Boyd College Connection</title>
      <link>http://ebsen.me/project/west-boyd-college-connection/</link>

      <guid>http://ebsen.me/project/west-boyd-college-connection/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The West Boyd College Connection is a resource for students primarily in the Nebraska school district beginning their research into post-secondary education. In addition to information on college interviews, applications, and campus visits, the website features a fairly exhaustive catalog of area scholarships.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Currently, the school&amp;rsquo;s guidance counselor curates this list of scholarships by hand, sorting them by due date. March alone includes roughly a hundred entries. The website is not particularly friendly to mobile displays devices either.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the new Drupal version of the site, she&amp;rsquo;ll enter every scholarship exactly the same way. Drupal&amp;rsquo;s powerful &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.drupal.org/project/views&#34;&gt;Views&lt;/a&gt; module will do all the sorting and categorized display for her. Students with mobile devices will be able to use the site as effectively as those with a laptop or desktop computer.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Rock Paper Scissors</title>
      <link>http://ebsen.me/project/rock-paper-scissors/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 12 Mar 2016 10:54:52 -0600</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://ebsen.me/project/rock-paper-scissors/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Rock, Paper, Scissors is a game many of us learn as children. I thought I could use it to learn more about event handlers and logic in the browser.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The app waits for you to choose between rock, paper, or scissors. Once you do, &lt;a href=&#34;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events&#34;&gt;an event fires&lt;/a&gt;. That event keeps a note of what you selected, gets the computer to pick, and notifies you whether you won or lost. The event only starts the game and updates the screen with the result. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t know anything about the game itself. For that, we look to the model.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The model contains the all logic for the game. It knows that scissors beats paper, paper beats rock, and so forth. It knows what you selected (because the event shared that information) and it knows how to tell the computer to select either rock, paper, or scissors at random. It then compares those two selections, decides the winner, and gives that information back to the event.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The event updates the page to tell you whether you won, lost, or tied, and goes back to waiting for another selection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It turns out, programming even very simple logic like &amp;ldquo;rock beats scissors, scissors beats paper, etc&amp;rdquo; can be done in all sorts of ways. I chose to keep the user interface and the game&amp;rsquo;s logic very separate because I know and like the &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller&#34;&gt;Model-View-Controller&lt;/a&gt; pattern used in &lt;a href=&#34;https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/General/Conceptual/DevPedia-CocoaCore/MVC.html&#34;&gt;iOS programming&lt;/a&gt; and web frameworks like &lt;a href=&#34;http://backbonejs.org/&#34;&gt;Backbone&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Songbook</title>
      <link>http://ebsen.me/project/songbook/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 05 Jan 2016 21:13:37 -0600</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://ebsen.me/project/songbook/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This project went through a lot of iterations before I finished. It turns out that HTML doesn&amp;rsquo;t really offer any kind semantic markup or even a microformat for song lyrics. This led me to experiment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I knew I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to manually update the HTML on every song every time I changed my mind. So I treated the lyrics themselves as data instead of markup. Then, I scripted the output I wanted with &lt;a href=&#34;http://jade-lang.com&#34;&gt;Jade&lt;/a&gt; and fed it the song data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, I could now change the markup &lt;em&gt;in a single place&lt;/em&gt; and all the songs would update. That&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don&#39;t_repeat_yourself&#34;&gt;the DRY principle&lt;/a&gt; at work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(If you&amp;rsquo;re curious, I ended up using &lt;a href=&#34;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/ul&#34;&gt;unordered lists&lt;/a&gt; for each line of the chorus and verses.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a result, this project includes &lt;a href=&#34;https://gist.github.com/ebsen/926a58fb21d5f7f3a20a&#34;&gt;the greatest, most beautiful piece of template code I&amp;rsquo;ve ever written&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>News Center</title>
      <link>http://ebsen.me/project/news-center/</link>

      <guid>http://ebsen.me/project/news-center/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;At the time it launched, the News Center represented our team&amp;rsquo;s most significant Drupal website to date and served as a demonstration to the campus community how Drupal could transform how we publish content to the web.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We spent a great deal of effort with this project to determine the needs of our news writers: what they wanted to accomplish from a news-publishing website, how their current tools were costing them time and effort, and what they wanted from an ideal setup.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With Drupal&amp;rsquo;s flexibility, we were able to customize the editing experience to make publishing stories and images quicker and less error-prone for the writers. Drupal&amp;rsquo;s powerful &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.drupal.org/project/views&#34;&gt;Views&lt;/a&gt; module also let us customize the website&amp;rsquo;s output, allowing us to categorize stories and display them across the site according to features or magazines printed by the marketing department.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>CommonSpot</title>
      <link>http://ebsen.me/project/commonspot/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 05 Jan 2016 21:02:05 -0600</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://ebsen.me/project/commonspot/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note&lt;/strong&gt;: This spring, we plan to launch our replacement of this site on &lt;a href=&#34;//www.drupal.org&#34;&gt;Drupal&lt;/a&gt;. Read more about our process for this &lt;a href=&#34;//sdstate.edu/cms&#34;&gt;on our site&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our main website, &lt;a href=&#34;//www.sdstate.edu&#34;&gt;sdstate.edu&lt;/a&gt;, consists of well over 10,000 pages and 15,000 documents. It is built in a &lt;a href=&#34;//coldfusion.adobe.com/coldfusion/&#34;&gt;ColdFusion&lt;/a&gt;-based CMS, &lt;a href=&#34;//www.paperthin.com/products/commonspot-cms.cfm&#34;&gt;CommonSpot&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since taking over responsibility for the site, I have worked with current and prospective students to better understand how they use and interact with the site. This resulted in some short-term improvements to the site but it contributed greatly to our long-term strategy for the web at South Dakota State.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we maintain the site, we are also bringing it under version control (&lt;a href=&#34;https://git-scm.com/&#34;&gt;Git&lt;/a&gt;, in this case) to allow us to monitor the changes we make to the code. This, along with the help of our student developer, has allowed us to increase CommonSpot&amp;rsquo;s performance by reducing the necessary code&amp;mdash;sometimes by as much as 50 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
