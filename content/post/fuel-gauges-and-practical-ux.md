If I leave the house in the morning with a quarter tank of gas or less in the car, I won't make it home again that night before the low fuel light turns on.

Like most fuel gauges, the one in my car is linear: with the quarter, half, and three-quarter markers equal distances from each other.

I don’t think about it that way. When the fuel is mostly full, I don’t care. When the fuel is mostly empty, I care a lot. As the fuel decreases, the value I assign to it increases.

Until a few years ago, I drove a late-eighties BMW 3 series. Among its many wonders, this little car offered [a logarithmic fuel gauge](https://www.google.com/search?q=e30+fuel+gauge).

Whereas my current car’s fuel gauge hovers near full, wanders down to half, and then plummets to empty, my old bimmer’s gauge would drop far more steadily. Since the bottom half of the tank took up the majority of the gauge, I got the most accurate fuel information _when I needed it most_.

I believe BMW eventually stopped doing this, so the marks on a modern 3 series gauge are spaced equally just like that of any other car. Still, I miss it.

P.S. This car’s gauge cluster also featured a needle for the current fuel economy directly below (opposite) the current speed. This let you immediately understand you fuel consumption as you accelerated.
