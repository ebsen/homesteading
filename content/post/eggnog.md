summary: "Make your own eggnog (alcholic or not) and skip the saccarine store-bought sludge."

As the days grow shorter and approach the holidays, I look forward to eggnog. For years, I just drank the store stuff but on a whim while my parents were staying I tried making it at home.

Like many things, the homemade version is infinitely better. Unlike many things, homemade eggnog is stupidly easy to make.

What follows is how I make it, slowly adapted from [the (far too boozy) original](http://www.jeffreymorgenthaler.com/2009/egg-nog/).

## And now, the goods:

Ingredients:

- 2 large eggs
- 1/2 cup sugar (or a little more to taste)
- 1 teaspoon nutmeg
- 1 teaspoon vanilla
- 12 ounces whole milk (1 1/2 cup)
- 8 ounces heavy whipping cream (1 cup)

Beat eggs for one minute on medium speed. Slowly add sugar and blend for one additional minute. Blend in the remaining ingredients: nutmeg, vanilla, milk and cream. Chill thoroughly to allow flavors to combine (at least a few hours) and serve with a little more nutmeg sprinkled on top.

This takes only about 10 minutes to do, plus at least a few hours to thoroughly chill in the fridge.

_P.S._ This recipe includes raw eggs. I figure if cookie dough doesn't hurt you, eggnog won't either.

_P.P.S._ I didn't include alchohol in this. If you want (and I sometimes do), add some. People seem to generally prefer brandy, dark rum, bourbon, or some combination.

_.P.P.S._ I also didn't include any consideration for your waistline. Heavy cream and whole milk (and don't even bother with the reduced fat nonsense) do not come cheap in the calorie department. Plan accordingly.
