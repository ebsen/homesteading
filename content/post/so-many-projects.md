title: So Many Projects
---

Before relaunching it as what it is now, this site served as a portfolio of personal and professional projects. Today, I finally got around to porting (most) of those projects over to this site.

Some of my personal favorites include:

- [Graduation 2015](/project/graduation-2015)
- [Hobo Day Parade](/project/hobo-day-parade)
- [News Center](/project/news-center)
- [Songbook](/project/songbook)

<!-- In addition to that, I finally corrected my long-standing error of not keeping this site under version control. While I struggle with how to represent everything that ebsen.me has contained, that's no reason not to track it _somehow_. -->

<!-- I had been dragging my feet on this because I couldn't decide between trying to self-host this site on a Raspberry Pi or just running it off GitHub Pages. Since my Pi just arrived yesterday, I'll need to play around with it for awhile before I make that decision. -->

Check out the [projects](/project) page for all the details.
