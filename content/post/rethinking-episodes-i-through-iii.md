title: Rethinking Episodes I through III
---

Like everyone else in the universe, I saw The Force Awakens over the holidays. The day after, I introduced my son (age six) to The Phantom Menace. 

He _loved_ it. 

Not only that, he loved most all the parts that cause me and so much of the rest of the Internet to groan and sigh and wail: the perpetual, gratuitous fish-eating-fish in the center of the earth; that a boy (hardly older than him) might fly a ship into space and knock out an entire starship by accident*; and, yes, Jar Jar Binks. 

Since he really doesn't follow dialogue, he completely missed everything about midi-chlorine. He missed a lot of things, really. He still absolutely loved it. 

* Actually, he loved all the accidents. He really enjoys physical comedy and, truthfully, The Phantom Menace deals it in spades. He laughed at every clumsy droid antic. Jar Jar's stupid stunts though really made him roll: The kid was jumping up and down at all the things that make me most cringe. 

I have heard George Lucas defend the movies in general (and Jar Jar in particular) as "Well, kids enjoy it." 

What surprised me most about the whole thing was how much more I enjoyed the film having him beside me. Sure, he asked a thousand questions, sometimes all at once. The dialogue kinda bored him too. Seeing him genuinely crack up so hard over all the cheesy stuff caused me to lighten up a little about the while thing. 

That night, he brought his light saber to bed. Episode I gave my son a lot of what he most loves: funny clumsy and light sabers. 

I didn't see these movies in the theater when they came out. In fact, The Firce Awakens is the only one I have seen in theater. I enjoyed it. It too though really plays up the fan favors.
