Like everyone else in the universe, I saw _The Force Awakens_ over the holidays. The day after, I introduced my son (age six) to _Episode I: The Phantom Menace_. 

**He loved it.**

Not only that, he loved most of all the parts that cause me and so much of the rest of the Internet to groan and sigh and wail: the perpetual, gratuitous fish-eating-fish in the center of the Naboo; that a boy (hardly older than him) might fly a ship into space and knock out an entire starship by accident; and, yes, Jar Jar Binks. 

Actually, he loved all the accidents. He really enjoys physical comedy and, truthfully, The Phantom Menace deals that out in spades. He laughed at every clumsy droid antic. Jar Jar's stupid stunts though really made him roll. The kid was jumping up and down in glee over all the things that make me cringe. 

Since he really doesn't follow dialogue, he completely missed everything about midi-chloridians. He missed a lot of things, really. He still absolutely loved it. 

I have heard George Lucas defend the movies in general (and Jar Jar in particular) as "Well, kids enjoy it." 

That my son loved this movie didn't really surprise me. What did surprise me was how much more _I_ enjoyed the film watching it with him. Sure, he asked a thousand questions, sometimes all at once. The dialogue mostly bored him. (On that, we agree.) Still, seeing him genuinely crack up so hard over all the cheesy stuff caused me to lighten up a little about the while thing. 

That night, he brought his toy light saber to bed with him.
