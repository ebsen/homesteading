title: "Drupal 8"
---

[Drupal 8](https://www.drupal.org/8) marks the first database-driven web framework that I honestly considered using for a personal project. I guess I launched a local instance of [Ghost](https://ghost.org) a few times and clicked around a bit but I never got anywhere near theming it. 

Honestly, I didn't care much for Drupal either when I first got started with it. I knew it made a lot of sense for our new university site, a project we started building this year in earnest, but I never truly considered using it myself. Still, the new version sounded kinda neat and I needed to learn it somehow. 

Fast forward into a week of evening tinkering and I _genuinely like_ Drupal 8.

It also lets me write (and publish) from anywhere, even my phone--something I couldn't do as easily from a static site.

And, as a side benefit, I get a head start with the tool that might drive my career at SD State for the next several years.
