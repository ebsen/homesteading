summary: "Making do with little"
title: The New MacBook
---

It is thin, light, and it is Retina. It offers an improved keyboard and it comes in black.

This is the laptop Iâ€™ve always wanted.

The key travel is much more shallow than anything else Apple makes. Once my fingers adjusted to this (after a few trials in the store), typing feels more like like floating your fingers over the keys just a little bit--like you don't need to press them so much as just _touch_ them.

It is also expensive, slow, and bound to improve greatly over the next few years.

This makes it a fascinating product and a terrible purchase.

I still want one.

_P.S_: Apple has since released an updated wireless keyboard, [the Magic Keyboard](http://www.apple.com/shop/product/MLA22LL/A/magic-keyboard-us-english). It uses scissor-switch keys like the rest of Apple's keyboards but a shallower key travel like the MacBook. I have one on order and I cannot wait for it to arrive.

_P.P.S_: The new external keyboard is _wonderful_.
