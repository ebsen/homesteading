Somehow, I expected that leaving [someplace I'd worked for nearly eight years](http://sdstate.edu) would involve more ceremony. It didn't. I announced that I was leaving and two weeks later, I left. That was pretty much it.

I programmed at State for years but I also wore a lot of other hats--like providing technical support and content strategy to the university's editors across campus--and over time I realized that as much as I like coding and as much success as I think we found with that there, the university needed someone to continue wearing those hats.

Later this month I will start my new job as a programmer for [The Good Samaritan Society](http://good-sam.com). Another team handles testing. Another team handles support. Since our team builds web apps rather than a single giant (largely informational) website, I won't be dealing with content in the same way that I did at a large sprawling public university website.

I can't wait to join a larger team with other, more experienced developers with whom I can ask questions or compare thoughts. I can't wait to work with a team that does dedicated testing. I can't wait to hand off support duties.

Most of all, I can't wait to start building software again.
