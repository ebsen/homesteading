title: Bootstrapping with the Bootstrap 4 Alpha
---

In preparation for [my new job](/post/graduating-from-college/), I started to redesign this site using Bootstrap 4. You are seeing the result of that work as you read this.

Overall, developing with Bootstrap was nice.

Like many fledgling web developers, I stumbled across Bootstrap and thought, _Wow, this is gonna save me so much work!_. However, I came to dislike "heavy" frameworks like Bootstrap (and Foundation) due to their, well, weight. They included far more code than I needed and invariably, they required me to write a bunch of CSS on top of them _anyway_ in order to get the design to match whatever master happened to be "guiding" this particular project.

My attitude on this changed with the start of my new job.
