When I found out Leonardo DiCaprio was doing a movie based on the true story of American frontiersman Hugh Glass, who was mauled by a bear in western South Dakota, left for dead, and crawled some 200 miles back to Fort Kiowa, South Dakota (near present-day Chamberlain).

I genuinely wanted to see _The Revenant_. Not because I particulary care for Leonardo DiCaprio but because I wantd to see a movie based on a true story from South Dakota's frontier days. 

Hugh Glass deserves some real credit: After being mauled by a bear and left for dead by his fellow fur-traders, he crawled some 200 miles 

I expected a disappointingly high about of violence. Unfortunately, Carole Cadwalladr, in her review for _The Guardian_, proves me right:

> Ritualised brutality. Vengeful blood lust. Vicious savagery justified by medieval notions of retribution. We all know how dark the world can be these days. A world where men are garrotted and impaled. Where they’re speared and disembowelled and have their necks slashed and their genitals sliced off. Where they’re killed for no other reason than revenge. This isn’t Raqqa, though, it’s _The Revenant_: the hottest blockbuster of the season[.]

She goes on.

> Director Alejandro González Iñárritu’s idea was for it to look as real as possible. Which would have been magnificent if there was something in the way of a story or any meditation on the nature of retribution or anyone – anyone – that you could give one toss about, but there’s not. So the landscape is chilling and the violence is pointless and the whole thing is meaningless. A vacuous revenge tale that is simply pain as spectacle. **The Revenant is pain porn.**

Emphasis mine but she isn't done.

> And in all probability, it will win every Oscar going. Critics have lavishly praised its “visceral” imagery, its “authentic” feel; it is, they say, “immersive” film-making at its finest. Though, arguably, not as immersive as putting a camera in a cage and then setting a man on fire. Have you seen that one? Where the man is burned alive? It’s not by González Iñárritu, but Isis. It wasn’t nominated for anything but the pain is even more real, more visceral, more – what was the word, thrilling? – than DiCaprio’s.

I urge you to read the entire review and really think about it.

People who know me in real life know that I get on this soapbox from time to time about the sheer amount of graphic violence openly displayed -- and praised! -- on screen today. Were frontier days as violent in real life as this movie depicts them? Probably. Does that mean we should see so for ourselves? **No.**

Why do I need to literally _view_ the act in order to understand that it occurred?

I can understand the depth of a wrong without _seeing_ it occur--in other ways. Literature and film can _convey_ terrible, depraved acts without _showing_ them.

This is why my wife and I stopped watching _House of Cards_ only a few episodes in, why I stopped watching _Marco Polo_ even sooner, and why we'll never even start _Game of Thrones_. They might well all include terrific acting and complicated, nuanced drama -- I'll never know because the graphic price just isn't worth it.

After all, we know that soldiers who witness the violence of war carry the scars of it long after. We call it PTSD. We know that people who live in violent neighborhoods develop similar (or even the very same) issues.

And yet, somehow we tell ourselves collectively as a culture that we don't experience these same effects on our brains if we watch them from the comfort of our living room rather than the chaos of a war zone.
