summary: "On finally getting around to doing something with this website again"
title: "Pulling the Trigger"
---

I've owned this domain for quite awhile. Every few years, I rebuild the website here and then let it sit mostly dormant until whenever I get around to completely rebuilding it again.

And yet, I've been writing this entire time. I just haven't been _publishing_.

So, here goes. With social media and the web in general increasingly corporate, tracked, and monetized, I like the idea of getting away from all that and owning my own words.

I don't expect a return to the hey-day of blogging that existed before social media swallowed it. I can still cross-post what I write here onto Facebook or Twitter or LinkedIn or Medium or wherever.

Right?
