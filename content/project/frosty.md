As the unit responsible for the university's public web presence, we support about 200 other faculty and staff around campus who regularly edit CommonSpot (and soon, Drupal) or another of our websites in some way. We wanted a way track their requests, both to ensure the work got done but also to build data around how people were using our sites. What common problems did they experience? Where was our documentation failing them?

As a joke, an earlier version of this tool was temporarily dubbed "Frosty Ticket." The name stuck, so when we decided to rebuild this system in Drupal, I knew we had to name it _Frosty Ticket 2.0_.

In its current state, Frosty Ticket 2.0 is a simple website. You log in, log the tasks you need to do, and mark them off as they're completed. We can note which college or unit a request belongs or assign a task to another user.
