An official university landing page to highlight the accomplishments of our graduating bachelors, masters, and Ph.D. students, including live streams of the commencement ceremonies over YouTube, [our own original recap video](https://youtu.be/VTRt64lE3uQ), and curated Instagram and Twitter posts.

As our first experience at streaming live video, we needed a lean website that would perform really well. So we opted to go without a database and we optimized common performance bottlenecks to reduce the size of the page.

I also worked with IT to put together a new way for us to publish the website. This also allows us to much more easily track changes in the code and revert them when bugs are discovered.

The live stream was a huge success for us, reaching hundreds of people across 26 states and 11 countries and reaching the highest number of mobile viewers (32%) of any university website to date. In the time since, the recap video has reached thousands of viewers.

The [current iteration of the graduation website](//graduation.sdstate.edu) adds [social media integration through Storify](https://storify.com/SDState/sdstate15), [a music playlist from Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/user/sdstate/playlist/2xNGtjV0ghaypMHwCmBwfv), and [a Facebook photo album](https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.10152904174661647.1073741842.88914146646&type=1). I also scripted our Git deployment process to make publishing and updating the site much simpler.

Building on success in our 2014, the website reached people in 43 states and 32 countries on commencement day. A strong majority of those visitors (57%) came from mobile, breaking our previous record. The Facebook photo album on the site reached over 100,000 people.
