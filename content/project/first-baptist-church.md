When we research a church, we look for a few general things:

When we started looking for chuches in our area, we wanted to know a few simple things right up front:

- What do you believe?
- When is the worship service?

So when we found a chuch we liked, 

We're hardly the only family that prefers to research a church a little before visiting (or even to find out when we _can_ visit), I offered to help them build one.

Since finding the when and where church service is most important (for newcomers), I put that information front and center. Deeper information like the [belief statement](http://www.firstbaptistwhite.org/what-we-believe/) and [church history](http://www.firstbaptistwhite.org/history/) are available from the menu. Contact information is persistent throughout, helping to make sure you can reach out if needed. I also included an [events calendar](http://www.firstbaptistwhite.org/new-events/) and the ability to post [audio messages](http://www.firstbaptistwhite.org/messages/) when we host outside speakers.

Building the site with [Squarespace](//squarespace.com) made the project very simple. Most of the work was simply talking through the goals we wanted to achieve with the site and assembling the resulting content into a sensible, straightforward information architecture. Squarespace already included everything we wanted, like a map, event calendar, and audio player.

We're a friendly church. I promise. If you're in the area, drop by!
