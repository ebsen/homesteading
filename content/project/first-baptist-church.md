Our family started looking for a new church last summer. Very quickly, we determined that two pieces of information matter very much on a church website:

- What does the church (proclaim to) believe?
- When is the service?

For us, this information conveys the basics. So when we settled into a local Baptist church, I offered to make them their first website.

Fresh from our experience researching churches, I put the when and where information front and center. Deeper information like the [belief statement](http://www.firstbaptistwhite.org/what-we-believe/) and [church history](http://www.firstbaptistwhite.org/history/) are available from the menu. Contact information is persistent throughout, helping to make sure you can reach out if needed. More recently, I included an [events calendar](http://www.firstbaptistwhite.org/new-events/) and the ability to post [audio messages](http://www.firstbaptistwhite.org/messages/) when we host outside speakers.

Building the site with [Squarespace](//squarespace.com) made the project very simple. Most of the work was simply talking through the goals we wanted to achieve with the site and assembling the resulting content into a sensible, straightforward information architecture. Squarespace already includes all the features we wanted--like a map, event calendar, and audio player.

We're a friendly church, I promise. If you're in the Brookings area, drop by!
