Some time after building [Dice](/project/dice), my wife asked if I could modify it to allow a wider range of possible numbers. So I forked Dice to create Ranger. 

Ranger started just to help her play Bingo with the kids but I hope to get back around it it and rebuild it with [Elm](http://elm-lang.org).
