**Note**: This spring, we plan to launch our replacement of this site on [Drupal](//www.drupal.org). Read more about our process for this [on our site](//sdstate.edu/cms).

Our main website, [sdstate.edu](//www.sdstate.edu), consists of well over 10,000 pages and 15,000 documents. It is built in a [ColdFusion](//coldfusion.adobe.com/coldfusion/)-based CMS, [CommonSpot](//www.paperthin.com/products/commonspot-cms.cfm).

Since taking over responsibility for the site, I have worked with current and prospective students to better understand how they use and interact with the site. This resulted in some short-term improvements to the site but it contributed greatly to our long-term strategy for the web at South Dakota State.

As we maintain the site, we are also bringing it under version control ([Git](https://git-scm.com/), in this case) to allow us to monitor the changes we make to the code. This, along with the help of our student developer, has allowed us to increase CommonSpot's performance by reducing the necessary code--sometimes by as much as 50 percent.
