title: About

I am a Christian, a husband, and a father of ~~three~~ (soon) four. 

Homesteading is both a place to write and a portfolio for my work. 

As a place to write, this site allows me an ownership over my words away from the din of social media and its increasingly onerous terms of use. 

As a portfolio, it serves as a place to promote the software I build, both professionally and for fun.

Hello. My name is Erik Ebsen. I'm a Christian, a husband, and a father of ~~three~~ four (soon). I grew up on a farm in [South Dakota](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Dakota) and--while college landed me across Europe, China, and Guatemala--I live there again today.

One thing that concerns me a little as our lives move more and more online is just how much certain companies (and our governments) know about our habits and behaviors--what we quite literally "like."

I hope to take a little of that control back. Rather than posting to Facebook or Twitter or wherever, perhaps I could cross-post what I write here into Facebook, Twitter, or wherever. All of the major services offer an API anyway.

What could go wrong?

<!-- > In the wake of the advent of podcasting and the growing hostility that occurs in written form on the web, it seems at best antiquated or quaint and at worst downright misguided to start writing more prominently on the web. So here I go. -->

<!-- This website is an experiment. It may well fail. -->

<!-- I want to strike out and make a place for myself outside the confines of our ever-increasing time-and-privacy-consuming social media. -->

<!-- Here goes. -->

I hope to use this site as a tool to take a little of that back. Rather than posting to Facebook or Twitter or wherever, perhaps I could cross-post what I write here into Facebook, Twitter, or wherever. All of the major services offer an API and, if this site runs Drupal already, it'll need to execute code anyway.
