title: About

I am a Christian, a husband, and a father of four. 

Homesteading is both a place to write and a portfolio for my work. 

As a place to write, this site allows me an ownership over my words away from the din of social media and its increasingly onerous terms of use. 

As a portfolio, it serves as a place to promote the software I build, both professionally and for fun.
