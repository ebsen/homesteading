# What a new site could look like

- Merriweather on high-DPI displays, fallback to Georgia
- Articles ending with
	```
	<- Title Title ->
	<< Title Title >>
	```
- Headline font stack to match sans serif stack from Bootstrap? or Open Sans
- Link style from Bootstrap branch of Homesteading
- Maybe small caps for links?
- Article bodies to start with a three-row initial letter
- Border-top 1px atop each section
- Columns (flexbox?) for body text on wide screens
- Summaries in italic
- Colors: saturated blue (from Homesteading) and greys from Btns
- Greys:
	white: #fff;
	grey-1: #f0f0f0;
	grey: #eee
	#ddd;
	grey-2: #555
	#777;
	#333;
- Article headlines on the top with navigation at bottom (or left on wide screens). Do this much like practicaltypography.com
- Adjust base font size by media query, not font scale.
- Tachyons or nothing.

```css
