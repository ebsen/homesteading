# What a new site could look like

- type and whitespace using Minor Second scale: 15:16 (1.067)
- Charter as web font, fallback to Georgia
- Navigation to next/previous post/project (with arrows)
- Margin-less images and code blocks
- Border top on article?
- Grid for lists?
- Full-width project image cut to top third with text scrolling in front
- Navigation at bottom?
- Review _Semantic CSS with Intelligent Selectors_ for more

## Older notes:

- Headline font stack to match sans serif stack from Bootstrap? or Open Sans
- Link style from Bootstrap branch of Homesteading
- Maybe small caps for links?
- Article bodies to start with a three-row initial letter
- Border-top 1px atop each section
- Columns (flexbox?) for body text on wide screens
- Summaries in italic
- Colors: saturated blue (from Homesteading) and greys from Btns
- Article headlines on the top with navigation at bottom (or left on wide screens). Do this much like practicaltypography.com
- Adjust base font size by media query, not font scale.
