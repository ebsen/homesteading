      <title>Graduating from College</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Somehow, I expected that leaving &lt;a href=&#34;http://sdstate.edu&#34;&gt;someplace I&amp;rsquo;d worked for nearly eight years&lt;/a&gt; would involve more ceremony. It didn&amp;rsquo;t. I announced that I was leaving and two weeks later, I left. That was pretty much it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I programmed at State for years but I also wore a lot of other hats&amp;mdash;like providing technical support and content strategy to the university&amp;rsquo;s editors across campus&amp;mdash;and over time I realized that as much as I like coding and as much success as I think we found with that there, the university needed someone to continue wearing those hats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Later this month I will start my new job as a programmer for &lt;a href=&#34;http://good-sam.com&#34;&gt;The Good Samaritan Society&lt;/a&gt;. Another team handles testing. Another team handles support. Since our team builds web apps rather than a single giant (largely informational) website, I won&amp;rsquo;t be dealing with content in the same way that I did at a large sprawling public university website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;rsquo;t wait to join a larger team with other, more experienced developers with whom I can ask questions or compare thoughts. I can&amp;rsquo;t wait to work with a team that does dedicated testing. I can&amp;rsquo;t wait to hand off support duties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of all, I can&amp;rsquo;t wait to start building software again.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Rethinking Episodes I through III</title>

      <description>&lt;!-- Note: With The Force Awakens arriving on iTunes and video earlier this month and the trailer for this year&#39;s Rogue One dropping this week, I thought this made as good a time as any to dust off and finish a post I started around the time that The Force Awakens hit theaters in the US. --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like everyone else in the universe, I saw &lt;em&gt;The Force Awakens&lt;/em&gt; over the holidays. The day after, I introduced my son (age six) to &lt;em&gt;Episode I: The Phantom Menace&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;He loved it.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not only that, he loved most of all the parts that cause me and so much of the rest of the Internet to groan and sigh and wail: the perpetual, gratuitous fish-eating-fish in the center of the Naboo; that a boy (hardly older than him) might fly a ship into space and knock out an entire starship by accident; and, yes, Jar Jar Binks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Actually, he loved all the accidents. He really enjoys physical comedy and, truthfully, The Phantom Menace deals that out in spades. He laughed at every clumsy droid antic. Jar Jar&amp;rsquo;s stupid stunts though really made him roll. The kid was jumping up and down in glee over all the things that make me cringe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since he really doesn&amp;rsquo;t follow dialogue, he completely missed everything about midi-chloridians. He missed a lot of things, really. He still absolutely loved it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have heard George Lucas defend the movies in general (and Jar Jar in particular) as &amp;ldquo;Well, kids enjoy it.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That my son loved this movie didn&amp;rsquo;t really surprise me. What did surprise me was how much more &lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt; enjoyed the film watching it with him. Sure, he asked a thousand questions, sometimes all at once. The dialogue mostly bored him. (On that, we agree.) Still, seeing him genuinely crack up so hard over all the cheesy stuff caused me to lighten up a little about the while thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That night, he brought his toy light saber to bed with him.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>So Many Projects</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Before relaunching it as what it is now, this site served as a portfolio of personal and professional projects. Today, I finally got around to porting (most) of those projects over to this site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of my personal favorites include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;ebsen.me/project/graduation-2015&#34;&gt;Graduation 2015&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;ebsen.me/project/hobo-day-parade&#34;&gt;Hobo Day Parade&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;ebsen.me/project/news-center&#34;&gt;News Center&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;ebsen.me/project/songbook&#34;&gt;Songbook&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;!-- In addition to that, I finally corrected my long-standing error of not keeping this site under version control. While I struggle with how to represent everything that ebsen.me has contained, that&#39;s no reason not to track it _somehow_. --&gt;

&lt;!-- I had been dragging my feet on this because I couldn&#39;t decide between trying to self-host this site on a Raspberry Pi or just running it off GitHub Pages. Since my Pi just arrived yesterday, I&#39;ll need to play around with it for awhile before I make that decision. --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Check out the &lt;a href=&#34;ebsen.me/project&#34;&gt;projects&lt;/a&gt; page for all the details.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Fuel Gauges and Practical UX</title>
      <link>/ebsen.me/post/fuel-gauges-and-practical-ux/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;If I leave the house in the morning with a quarter tank of gas or less in the car, I won&amp;rsquo;t make it home again that night before the low fuel light turns on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like most fuel gauges, the one in my car is linear: with the quarter, half, and three-quarter markers equal distances from each other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t think about it that way. When the fuel is mostly full, I don’t care. When the fuel is mostly empty, I care a lot. As the fuel decreases, the value I assign to it increases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Until a few years ago, I drove a late-eighties BMW 3 series. Among its many wonders, this little car offered &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.google.com/search?q=e30+fuel+gauge&#34;&gt;a logarithmic fuel gauge&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whereas my current car’s fuel gauge hovers near full, wanders down to half, and then plummets to empty, my old bimmer’s gauge would drop far more steadily. Since the bottom half of the tank took up the majority of the gauge, I got the most accurate fuel information &lt;em&gt;when I needed it most&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I believe BMW eventually stopped doing this, so the marks on a modern 3 series gauge are spaced equally just like that of any other car. Still, I miss it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;P.S. This car’s gauge cluster also featured a needle for the current fuel economy directly below (opposite) the current speed. This let you immediately understand you fuel consumption as you accelerated.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Pulling the Trigger</title>
      <link>/ebsen.me/post/pulling-the-trigger/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve owned this domain for quite awhile. Every few years, I rebuild the website here and then let it sit mostly dormant until whenever I get around to completely rebuilding it again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And yet, I&amp;rsquo;ve been writing this entire time. I just haven&amp;rsquo;t been &lt;em&gt;publishing&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, here goes. With social media and the web in general increasingly corporate, tracked, and monetized, I like the idea of getting away from all that and owning my own words.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t expect a return to the hey-day of blogging that existed before social media swallowed it. I can still cross-post what I write here onto Facebook or Twitter or LinkedIn or Medium or wherever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Right?&lt;/p&gt;
